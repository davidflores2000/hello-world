# hello-world

This is my first respository

I'm currently on an M.Sc. research project titled "estimation of the frequency and effects of causal mutations on fertility and production traits in irish daiy and beef cattle".

I will be using python and R to complete this project due to the massive amounts of data available. I am new to programming but am eager to learn and apply what I know. I'm not just going through the motions.
